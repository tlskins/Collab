Collab is a repository that promotes creative collaboration on a project.<br /><br />

Collab is more visual and interactive than traditional file systems but more organized than traditional digital interactions (email, facebook). Collab follows a comment - leaf - branch idea development structure and broad collaborator access in an attempt to help decentralize collaboration in order to foster creativity.<br /><br />

What Wikipedia is for facts and historical records, Collab aims to be for more creative topics. We are currently leveraging universal commenting, notifications, integration with youtube, simple and effective layouts using Bootstrap 4, and a comment - leaf branch architecture to provide the most collaborative environment possible.<br /><br /><hr class="my-4"><br /><br />

<b>So what is comment - leaf - branch architecture?</b><br /><br />

In this architecture a project has many branches which serve to categorize distinct ideas. These ideas can take the form of comments, leaves, and other branches. The difference between these structures correlate with the degree to which the idea has been fully formed. A comment can be a nascent idea that just popped into your head after checking out someone else's branch. Then after doing research you can turn your comment into leaves after adding supporting youtube videos, links, and input from other collaborators. Finally after the leaves warrant their own repository they can be gathered into their own branch.
